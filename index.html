<h1>A Little History </h1>
</title>
<font size= "5">
Chess has been around for ages. It's a two player game of strategy played on a checkered 8x8 grid. The game can be played aggressively or very passive and defensive. The game is played all across the world. Over the years, many styles of play have developed in differnt countries of the world. These styles of play have been developed by the best players in the world and now the opening set of theory have been named. There are many different openings that are played in the current world of chess, however some of the popular would be the French defence, the Sicilian Defense, Queen's Gambit and many more. What is really impressive is that the best players in the world can calculate the best move possible, 5-10 moves ahead.

The match went 6-6 and had to go to tie-break matches as the decider. Of those 3 matches, Carlson had won all 3, leading him to remain the World Champion as of current.
